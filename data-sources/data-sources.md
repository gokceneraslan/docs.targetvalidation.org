# Data sources

We collect evidence \(E\) from various data sources \(e.g. Reactome, SLAPenrich, PROGENy, CRISPR, and SysBio\) to allow for target identification and prioritisation when using the [Open Targets Platform](https://www.targetvalidation.org/). 

We group similar data sources into broader categories called Data types \(e.g. Pathways & systems biology, previously known as Affected pathways, for Reactome, SLAPenrich, PROGENy, CRISPR, and Sysbio\) to associate targets \(T\) with diseases \(D\).

These are the current data types.

* [Genetic associations](https://docs.targetvalidation.org/data-sources/genetic-associations)
* [Somatic mutations](https://docs.targetvalidation.org/data-sources/somatic-mutations)
* [Drugs](https://docs.targetvalidation.org/data-sources/drugs)
* [Pathways & systems biology](https://docs.targetvalidation.org/data-sources/affected-pathways)
* [RNA expression](https://docs.targetvalidation.org/data-sources/rna-expression)
* [Text mining](https://docs.targetvalidation.org/data-sources/text-mining)
* [Animal models](https://docs.targetvalidation.org/data-sources/animal-models)

{% tab title="Note" %}
Evidence from an individual data source can contribute to different data types, e.g. data from EVA is used as evidence for both Genetic associations and Somatic mutations, depending on whether the evidence is germline or somatic mutation, respectively.
