# API Tutorials

Here we include a list of tutorials for programmatic access of the Open Targets Platform data.

You will be using either the Python client or accessing the Open Targets Platform REST API directly.

If you want to suggest new tutorials or new use cases for our REST API or Python client, please [email us](mailto:support@targevalidation.org).
