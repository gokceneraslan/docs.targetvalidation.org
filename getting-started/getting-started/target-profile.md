# Target profile

When searching for a target, in addition to the list of diseases associated with it, you will also see at the top of the page the ‘View TARGET profile’ link e.g. 'View BRAF profile'. Click on the link to get information on your target of interest, outside the context of associated diseases. 

In the target profile page, you will see the target official symbol, its description and synonyms, the latter two provided by UniProt. Scroll down to see detailed information on the target \(e.g. Drugs, Protein interactions\) and the original resource of the data \(e.g. ChEMBL, OmniPath DB\):

* Target safety \(manual curation of three publications - [PMID:28216264](http://europepmc.org/abstract/MED/28216264), [PMID:23197038](http://europepmc.org/abstract/MED/23197038), [PMID:28453775](http://europepmc.org/abstract/MED/28453775), a book chapter by [Urban et al. 2012](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/9781118098141.ch2), and the 

  Hepatic and Cardiac Toxicity Systems modelling project - [HeCaToS](https://www.hecatos.eu/)\) 

{% hint style="success" %}
The target safety data summarises toxic effects if/when modulating a given target. It includes `known safety effects` and `safety risk information.`

This data is currently available for 193 targets, such as [PTGS2](https://www.targetvalidation.org/target/ENSG00000073756) and [BRAF](https://www.targetvalidation.org/target/ENSG00000157764).
